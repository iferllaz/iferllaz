## Hello there 👋
## I'm Julia Llaz

I'm a future Intelligent Computing Engineer who's working to get better everytime. And I'm pleased to introduce you to my learning playground, but before, I will talk to you a little about myself... 

- 🔭 I’m currently enrolled to complete a Computer Science degree, I will officially become an Intelligent Computing Engineer sooner than you may think.
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in learning everything I can about Python and its applications in data science and artificiall intelligence, however I'm aware of other incredible tools and languages that exist around us.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and AI projects, in order to learn every possible thing.
- 📫 You can reach me thrugh Github DM's.
- ⚡ Unsolicited facts:
  *  I like learning what I need to learn, and what I can't learn, I'm sure I can learn to learn it.
  *  I'm currently big on vapor, synth, cyber and retro-wave stuff
  *  I like to play videogames, but my taste is hard to clasify, all I can say is i prefer enjoying them rather than get too competitive (unless is about Rocket League)
