# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julia Llaz

I'm a future Intelligent Computing Engineer who's working to get better everytime. And I'm pleased to introduce you to my learning playground, but before, I will talk to you a little about me:
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning everything I can about Python and its applications in data science and artificiall intelligence, however I'm aware of other incredible tools and languages that exist around us.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science and AI projects, in order to learn every possible useful thing.
  
- âš¡ Unsolicited facts:
    
  *  I'm currently big on vapor, synth, cyber and retro-wave stuff
    
  *  I like to play videogames, but my taste is hard to classify, all I can say is i prefer enjoying them rather than get too competitive (unless is about Rocket League)
