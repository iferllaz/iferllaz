# Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Julia Llaz

I'm a future Intelligent Computing Engineer who's everyday working to get better at her passion. And I'm pleased to introduce you to my learning playground, but before, I will talk to you a little about me:
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning everything I can about Computer Science and its benefits to society. I'm big on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and I have a strong interest in Network Engineering.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science, AI, Web and Software projects, in order to contribute to society.
  
- âš¡ Unsolicited facts:
    
  *  I'm enthusiastic about vapor, synth, cyber, retro and almost everything-wave art and music.
    
  *  I like videogames, but my taste is hard to classify, all I can say is i prefer enjoying them rather than get too competitive (unless we talk about Rocket League)
